        <p>Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from similar, much older games of Indian and Persian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.</p>
        <p>Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>

        <h1>My Life Summary</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <br>
        <p>A mini life journey of a 11 y/o kid, Aishwarya dhoot. I reside in Indore (madhya pradesh) and
            study here in one of the top schools sri sathya sai vidya vihar, a student of class 8th (session
            2021-22).
            My chess journey started in 2015 and in 2019 I became a national chess player.
            When I was six years old my mother started my chess coaching during summer vacation. For
            three months I took my coaching from Dinesh sir, a very passionate coach who uplifted my
            chess training and after some time I started to play in the tournaments in my colony itself to
            upgrade my growth, learn new techniques from my fellow beings and practice more and more
            chess. While playing tournaments when i used to get second or third position and get medals,
            my interest in chess increased and gradually I started to become captivated in chess and
            started playing online chess games in my free time cause their was not much people with whom
            i can play offline.I had a passion to win in chess,my mother saw my interest and made me
            choose chess as a sport in school. I had taken 2-years coaching then gradually started playing
            tournaments out of Indore.
            At a very small age I went to Udaipur, Surat, Delhi, and many more places inside Indore.
            I won state level and national level tournament under 11
            My group and I went to Surat for CBSEWEST ZONE from school and won first position in the
            U11 category and won nationals in Delhi and there also won 1 st position.
            I also pay attention to my study with ongoing chess tournaments. For me chess is my subject,
            not a game. It’s something which make me happy and give me good vibes.
            My mother helps me a lot in my chess classes, she helps me in my school work and keep me up
            to date so that I can concentrate on my co-curricular activities and give more time to chess. I do
            many activities like kathak, coding and singing and i have classes for all of them which makes
            my schedule very busy and with that I find time to play out-door games too.
            I give daily time to chess, one hour at least. When I am sad and don’t feel like doing anything so
            i play chess. I focus on many activities from childhood, and that too with my studies, I want to
            score top marks and I’m sure I’ll do that.I want to make myself an all-rounder till class 12th so
            yes my time is very important till 12th .
            We Should not lose confidence till the end. Winning and losing are part of life and we
            should increase our confidence after losing. This is a very important thing which i have
            learned while playing. We should Boost our spirit more than becoming sad and crying. we

            should give daily time to achieve our goals and make a regular schedule and be determined on
            it, that’s what I do.
            I want to become the queen of chess who pays attention to all the pieces including pawns.
            Chess is a mind sharpening game and we can play at any age and I want to continue it all my
            life.
            Main parinda kyun Banu mujhe assamaan banana Hai
            Main ek Panna kyun Banaya mujhe dastan banana Hai...
            My team won the junior national award in 2019 when I was 10 years old. Now I want to win the
            world junior championship and make India proud. I want to become a grandmaster till I am 18
            years old. I do self-practice for a minimum of 1 hour a day. Due to the pandemic everyone had
            to stay in their homes but I didn't stop playing chess and play in regular tournaments. I
            remember the days when I used to go to other cities to play but now offline tournaments are not
            in progress so even state matches are held online. I have some friends on lichess and
            chess.com with whom I play. I love playing chess with people from foreign countries and when
            they lose I feel proud to be an Indian. I also had to struggle a lot for this, some people cheat in
            online games due to which i lose my app rating and that’s very hurtful. People take help from
            people analyzing computers and games but my mom and my school teaches that we should
            play this game honestly so that’s how you will come to know about your rank and where you
            stand. If you want to win then you have to think about the game and keep in mind about your
            strategy so that you can defeat your opponent, you have to think carefully about what steps you
            should do next in order to capture the king and checkmate. I have got money checks of Rs. 500,
            1000, 2000 which my mother has kept separately in an envelope. When we go to another city
            due to changes in environment, food and water, the health of small children may get unpleasant.
            Once,while playing in a tournament, my stomach ache started. Because of my low immunity my
            mom always keeps medicine and pudhinara, but due to stomach ache I lost the match but still
            learned a lot from that situation and will never let that mistake happen in future. Once during a
            match in Delhi I got a fever but i still won that match. My mother always accompanies me during
            my matches. As now chess is on an online platform which is a great thing for chess players.
            Special thanks to people who have given us an opportunity to keep our game going and keep
            our game in practice. I am good at studies and get above 90%. My school teachers also support
            me and never let our confidence go down if we lose a match. If any student can’t attend classes
            due to competitions, teachers provide us with notes.
            Chess is my Passion, I have to go ahead by giving time to chess, I want to take India ahead
            through chess.
            “Don’t be afraid of losing be afraid of losing and not learning something from it”
            Every
            Game should be played with dedication, we should have the eagerness to grow
            day-by-day. I see the games of success players and make some tricks, I want to
            bring India forward through chess, If we
            do this from childhood, then no one can stop our country from becoming
            self-reliant, for this I have to achieve slowly, I will make people aware of
            this game so that more and more people can become aware and start knowing like
            cricket.

            I will be
            making villagers aware about chess. So from there also some intelligent people
            come forward. Like many people in the city, they are more intelligent villagers
            But no, there is no difference between citizens and villagers. That's why
            I want to give opportunities to villagers too.
            I know it is difficult but we can do it. Many people play games for confidence,
            leadership, etc. but I play with intimacy, humanity, and the soul of the game.

            There is not much publicity for chess. Many people do not play this game as they think that we
            should play outdoor games only. Social media, television and Sponsor Company do not pay
            attention. Cricket is a very public game and I want that Chess should also be public like cricket.
            And I want villagers to also come forward and take the opportunity.

            I tell the the benefits to my friends so they will also come forward, Some of them are-
            Brings Intimacy, Develops problem-solving skills, Teaches us how to win and lose, Help in focus,

            Build confidence, Better brain function, Bring people together, Chess teaches humanity, Helps
            us focus on everything, Exercises my mind, Chess increases my intelligence and How to apply
            problem solved by others to our own situation.

            I solve many puzzles book in nitesh, post help me in winning the game, when I use the game, I
            have learned something from defeat and loss and do analysis 10 times before covid-19 Most of
            the time travel for the first few years I am very happy to play tournament, just try and do it and
            achieve it, success definitely comes.
            Many people get disappointed after losing, but we should not be disappointed that we should
            analyze the mistakes of the game.

            “Despite the development of chess theory there is much that remains secret and unexporald in
            chess ”
            “I love all positions, give me a difficult position game, I will play it, But totally won position, I
            cannot stand them”
            “Only the players with the initiative has the right to attack”
            “Chess is a war over the board. The object is to crush the opponent's mind.”
            “A strong memory, concentration, imagination and a strong will is required to become a great
            chess player.” </p>

Each player begins with a total of sixteen pieces (but see the subsection below for other usage of the term piece). The pieces that belong to each player are distinguished by color. The lighter colored pieces are referred to as "white," and the player that owns them, "White". The darker colored pieces are referred to as "black", and the player that owns them, "Black".

In a standard game, each of the two players begins with the following sixteen pieces:

1 king
                                                <br>
